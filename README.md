   ```

### Post-Installation Steps

After installing on any platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux), complete the following steps:

#### 1. (Optional) Build the API Database

This repository already includes a pre-built database, so this step is optional. Only run this if you need to use a newer ConnectWise API definition file:

```bash
# On Windows
python build_database.py path/to/manage.json

# On macOS/Linux
python3 build_database.py path/to/manage.json
```

This step only needs to be done once, or whenever the ConnectWise API definition changes.

#### 2. Configure API Credentials

Set the following environment variables with your ConnectWise credentials:
```
CONNECTWISE_API_URL=https://your-instance.connectwise.com/v4_6_release/apis/3.0
CONNECTWISE_COMPANY_ID=your_company_id
CONNECTWISE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
CONNECTWISE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
CONNECTWISE_AUTH_PREFIX=yourprefix+  # Prefix required by ConnectWise for API authentication
```

These credentials are used in the authentication process as follows:

- **CONNECTWISE_API_URL**: The base URL for all API requests to your ConnectWise instance
  ```
  url = f"{API_URL}{endpoint}"  # e.g., https://your-instance.connectwise.com/v4_6_release/apis/3.0/service/tickets
  ```

- **CONNECTWISE_COMPANY_ID**: Included in the 'clientId' header of each request to identify your company
  ```
  headers = {'clientId': COMPANY_ID, ...}
  ```

- **CONNECTWISE_PUBLIC_KEY** and **CONNECTWISE_PRIVATE_KEY**: Used together with AUTH_PREFIX to create the basic authentication credentials
  ```
  username = f"{AUTH_PREFIX}{PUBLIC_KEY}"  # e.g., "yourprefix+your_public_key"
  password = PRIVATE_KEY
  credentials = f"{username}:{password}"  # Combined into "yourprefix+your_public_key:your_private_key"
  ```

- **CONNECTWISE_AUTH_PREFIX**: Required prefix added before your public key in the authentication username. ConnectWise API requires this prefix to identify the type of integration (e.g., "api+", "integration+", etc.)

The final HTTP headers sent with every request will look like:
```
'Authorization': 'Basic [base64 encoded credentials]'
'clientId': 'your_company_id'
'Content-Type': 'application/json'
```

)
```

## Understanding Fast Memory

The Fast Memory feature allows you to save and retrieve frequently used API queries, optimizing your workflow in several ways:

### Benefits

- **Time Savings:** Quickly execute complex API calls without remembering exact endpoints or parameters
- **Error Reduction:** Reuse successful API calls to minimize potential errors
- **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns which API calls are most valuable to you
- **Parameter Persistence:** Parameters and request bodies are stored for future use

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Learning:** When you execute a successful API call, you're prompted to save it to Fast Memory
2. **Intelligent Retrieval:** The next time you use the same API endpoint, the system checks Fast Memory first
3. **Parameter Reuse:** If you don't provide parameters for a call, the system automatically uses those saved in Fast Memory
4. **Usage Tracking:** The system tracks how often each query is used and prioritizes frequently used queries

### Fast Memory Functionality

- **Automatic Parameter Suggestion:** The system will suggest parameters from Fast Memory if none are provided
- **Usage Counter:** Each time a query from Fast Memory is used, its usage count increases
- **Search Capability:** Search through your saved queries by description or endpoint path
- **Prioritization:** Queries are displayed in order of usage frequency, with most frequently used queries at the top

### Managing Your Fast Memory

- **View Saved Queries:** `list_fast_memory()`
- **Search Specific Queries:** `list_fast_memory("search term")`
- **Delete a Query:** `delete_from_fast_memory(query_id)`
- **Clear All Queries:** `clear_fast_memory()`

### Fast Memory Technical Details

The Fast Memory system is powered by a SQLite database (`fast_memory_api.db`) that stores:

- Query paths and methods
- Parameters and request bodies as JSON
- Usage metrics and timestamps
- User-friendly descriptions

The database structure includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each saved query
- `description`: User-provided description of what the query does
- `path`: API endpoint path
- `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- `params`: Query parameters in JSON format
- `data`: Request body in JSON format
- `timestamp`: When the query was last used
- `usage_count`: How many times the query has been used

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Not Found Error

```
Error: Database file not found at [path]
Please run build_database.py script first to generate the database
```

**Solution:** Run the `build_database.py` script with the path to your ConnectWise API definition file:
```bash
python build_database.py path/to/manage.json
```

#### API Authentication Issues

```
HTTP error 401: Unauthorized
```

**Solution:** Check your environment variables to ensure all ConnectWise credentials are correct:
- Verify your `CONNECTWISE_COMPANY_ID`, `CONNECTWISE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and `CONNECTWISE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions in ConnectWise
- Check that `CONNECTWISE_AUTH_PREFIX` is set correctly for your environment

#### Timeouts on API Calls

```
Request timed out. ConnectWise API may be slow to respond.
```

**Solution:** 
- Check your internet connection
- The ConnectWise API may be experiencing high load
- For large data requests, consider adding more specific filters to your query

### Logs and Diagnostics

#### Log Locations

- Main log file: `api_gateway/api_gateway.log`
- SQLite databases:
  - API Database: `api_gateway/connectwise_api.db`
  - Fast Memory Database: `api_gateway/fast_memory_api.db`

#### Testing the Database

Verify that the database is correctly built and accessible:
```bash
python test_database.py
```

This will display statistics about the database and confirm it can be queried properly.

## Advanced Usage

### Optimizing API Queries

For better performance with the ConnectWise API:

1. **Use Specific Conditions:** Narrow your queries with precise conditions
   ```python
   execute_api_call("/service/tickets", "GET", {
       "conditions": "status/name='Open' AND dateEntered > [2023-01-01T00:00:00Z]"
   })
   ```

2. **Limit Field Selection:** Request only the fields you need
   ```python
   execute_api_call("/service/tickets", "GET", {
       "conditions": "status/name='Open'",
       "fields": "id,summary,status,priority"
   })
   ```

3. **Paginate Large Results:** Use page and pageSize parameters
   ```python
   execute_api_call("/service/tickets", "GET", {
       "conditions": "status/name='Open'",
       "page": 1,
       "pageSize": 50
   })
   ```
